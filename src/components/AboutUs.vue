              At Elizabeth by Design we design and make clothing for the mature woman. 
              We are based in Auckland and we deliver anywhere in New Zealand.<br><br>
              Typically it takes 6 weeks to make a garment. This includes consultation
               about design, making a mockup to make sure we have the design right, 
               purchase <br>of fabric and then creation and fitting process.<br><br>
              We use both face to face and online platforms to meet and discuss what 
              garment you are hoping to have made.

              You might like to start by  going to our <b>Understanding of Your Style page</b>.
              This page asks some questions and provides guidance about knowing what works for you.<br><br>
              Also Have a look at our gallery of photos on our <b>Where are you going?</b> page. 
              We do not sell off the shelf and so images you view are one-off garments.
               These photos might give you some ideas about what you are looking for. 
              Kerry will work directly with you to design exactly what you want.<br><br>
              Once you are ready, use our <b>Get In Touch</b> page to make contact with Kerry. You can call Kerry or email her with a preferred time to meet. Meetings can be online or face to face - depending on where you live.

              Meet with Kerry either face to face or online. 
              Allow about an hour to talk through the style colours, fabrics for your 
              garment. At this time we will take your body measurements. <br><br>
              Kerry will provide you with drawings of the garment for your approval. 
              Once approved Kerry will make up a mockup of the garment, if you choose
               this option (recommended for formal dresses, coats and casual dresses).

              Once we are confident we have the right style and we know the fabric we will use, 
              Kerry will create your garment. A final fitting is recommended before completion.
