                  <br>
                  <p class="card-text"> I am 62 years young and  I want to share with you my story and why 
                    I have developed such a drive and passion for designing and creating clothing for the mature woman.
                    <br><br>
                    At the age of just 12 years of age my grandmother Elizabeth Brennan, sat me down in front of an
                    old Singer treadmill sewing machine and helped me to make my very first garment. 
                    It was my high school uniform, complete with boxed pleats and insert pockets. 
                    My Grandma guided and encouraged me every step of the way.  
                    I thought I was the cleverest person alive.<br><br>

                    I remember the feeling of amazement knowing that I had created this garment from
                    what had started out as a flat piece of woven cloth. My love of sewing grew from 
                    there. Over the years I have made many garments for myself, family and friends. 
                    Designing and  sewing was not to be a career pathway but rather a much loved 
                    hobby that I was very good at.<br><br>

                  <br>
                  <p class="card-text"> My career took me to the education sector and then to the corporate world where I
                     facilitated meetings, spoke at conferences, and worked with people every day. 
                     I always needed to look my best.<br><br>

                     My greatest joy is to design and make the clothing I wear. Whether it be an outfit
                    to go to work, go to a party, go dancing or go away on holiday.
                    I love the challenge of working out styling, colours, and fabrics.
                    I always feel great in the outfits I create and that is because I 
                    know what works for me.<br><br>

                    My friends tell me that as they have aged, it has become harder to find 
                    styles that work for them. A walk through any shopping area will show 
                    that many shops cater for the young woman and at best make a poor attempt
                     to cater for the mature woman.

                      Clothing is either completely the wrong style
                      and shape for the mature woman or what is available is dull, baggy and not made 
                      to show off our best features.<br><br>
                      
                      The lack of beautifully designed clothing for the mature woman has led me back 
                      to my love of sewing and design but with the more mature woman in mind. 
                      I get great joy in working with a woman to work out what garments she 
                      requires, the styles and colours that will work and then being able to 
                      create a bespoke garment for her.<br><br>

                      The mature woman deserves to look fabulous and together we can achieve your
                       own style of fabulous.  I would be delighted to offer my services to work 
                       with you to design and create clothing that can take the mature woman 
                       anywhere she wants to go!way but rather a much loved 
                    hobby that I was very good at.

                <br><br>At Elizabeth by Design we design and make clothing for the mature woman. 
                We are based in Auckland and we deliver anywhere in New Zealand.<br><br>
                Typically it takes 6 weeks to make a garment. This includes consultation
                about design, making a mockup to make sure we have the design right, 
                purchase <br>of fabric and then creation and fitting process.<br><br>
                We use both face to face and online platforms to meet and discuss what 
                garment you are hoping to have made.

              Allow about an hour to talk through the style colours, fabrics for your 
              garment. At this time we will take your body measurements. <br><br>
              Kerry will provide you with drawings of the garment for your approval. 
              Once approved Kerry will make up a mockup of the garment, if you choose
              this option (recommended for formal dresses, coats and casual dresses).
